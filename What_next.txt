What next?

Possible bugs:
- Standardize on square format or check for use of width (replace with height)

- Not allow spawn from mouse just anywhere?

Could be improved with:
- A neater way of stopping once the radius gets super-small (or x # frames after start?)
- bkgCol changes on respawn? 
- Remove "trails" option
- Screendump should work
- Update p5.js version?
- A way to tweak some of the parameters in the DNA? (max/min values for randomised properties, perhaps?)
- remove wraparound if it isn't in use (see 'death')
- is this.colonySize in use? Removed from GUI...

Instructions?
Naming convention - what is this generator called?

How to go on from here towards being able to use the GUI to tweak the generators (& save presets to JSON?)

This could potentially run as a standalone at Tomra....
