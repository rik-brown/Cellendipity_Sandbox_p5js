WHAT NEXT????
-------------

Known BUGS:
===========

The overall structure seems vastly overcomplicated!
Colour > DNA > Colour etc. SIMPLIFY IT!
Rather than each cell having their own dna, could they in theory pick up their local values directly from the genepool?
(would require the genepool being additively populated as new combinations arise, which could be ineffective, but still maybe less inefficient than 1 dna per cell)
Maybe there is a way to include a color variable directly in the DNA?

One slider per variable to determine the 'middle value'
One 'variance' to determine the amount of 'random variation' around that value, which could be 100% upto 200% (x2) or (*0.5/*2.0) or +/- 50%
+ 100% = x2
- 100% = *0.5
Variance will apply to all variables in 'DNA tweaks': startsize/endsize/lifespan/noise/twist/transparency?

I NEED A WAY TO MAKE VARIANCE RANGE EXTEND BOTH ABOVE AND BELOW THE SELECTED VALUE (WITHIN LIMITS)
MAYBE I CAN USE 'CONSTRAIN'?

Now:
Each Cell has it's own DNA.
In the initial spawn, cell DNA is picked from a set of 5 DNA in a prepopulated 'genepool' array.
In cells spawned from a conception-event, dna is recombined to make a new, unique individual (though this is not currently added to the genepool)
Gene-values for the genepool-DNA are assigned (in dna.js constructor) within limits given by variables in global_settings (& editable in the GUI)
The goal is for random variation within controllable limits (as full-scale random often results in a mess)
Currently, the limits can be specified as Min-Max but this is clumsy in the GUI (due to lack of 'from-to' slider)

I will therefore keep the 'Min' value (& slider) but add a general 'Diversity' or 'Variance' slider which affects all values across the board.
The expression of this 'variance' will be within the DNA constructor.

Do I expect there to be some degree of random variation within a strain?
If so, this will need to occur in the individual cell constructor.

Suspected BUGS: (needs investigation)
=====================================


Possible IMPROVEMENTS:
======================

If you change the colour of a strain (A-E) then that strain is the one you spawn with next mouseclick

Shortcut 'G' for grayscale - executes a function which sets all saturation values to 0 & repopulates colony
Might need a 'reverse' or opposite (full saturation)
Or perhaps some global sliders?

- Optimalisation: DNA genes that never change, could they be replaced by simple local variable in the cell? (or lookup to genepool?)
Current examples: SpawnCount

- this.remoteness : Is it actually needed, or is this.maturity (mapped to range) sufficient?
- gs.stepped - Is it needed, or is this covered by stepSize = 0? Should it be true to start with?
  I think I have fixed it now so it never becomes false, and all is running normally
  Remove at a later stage (in a fork)

  Can remove 2 genes (20 & 21) since home is given directly from gs variables:
  this.home = new p5.Vector(gs.homeX, gs.homeY); //cell has origin

- Better alternative for Max/Min in GUI? Typed values?

- GUI folders for DNA overrides
  > Overrides could be 1-9) Setting value 0) "Diversity" "Variance" - scaling value for all DNA?
  Would reduce the need for both Max & Min variables too :-)
  Like http://rik-brown.github.io/Cellendipity/

- Look at aybe_sea - it runs smooth, the GUI is not over-complex. Could I just rebuild that to make a 'mandala' pattern?
- It has a nice 'randomize on restart' function

REMEMBER! Scaling is important: use relative sizes IMPORTANT!!
REMEMBER! populateColony() does not refresh Global_settings!!

Ideas for NEW FEATURES:
=======================
+ Instead of specifying individual Strain colors, specify ANGULAR HUE OFFSET between strains?
If (key = '1') {gs = new Global_settings_1}
If (key = '2') {gs = new Global_settings_2}
If (key = '3') {gs = new Global_settings_3}
If (key = '4') {gs = new Global_settings_4}
To select a predefined set of global_settings

TASKS:
======
- Window resize?
- Naming convention - what is this generator called?

How to go on from here towards being able to use the GUI to tweak the generators (& save presets to JSON?)

This could potentially run as a standalone at Tomra....
