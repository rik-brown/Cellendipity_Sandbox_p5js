What next?

Known BUGS:
===========
Fill colour for DNA in genepool was not working - just turned BLACK on change in GUI.
Think I know what this could've been caused by (not * 255 on s & v).
This whole structure seems vastly overcomplicated!
Colour > DNA > Colour etc. SIMPLIFY IT!
I'm not even 100% sure I like the result - selecting colours rather than random just leads to a lot of fiddling around.
Maybe just keep everything randomised?

Black borders are not refreshed often enough to hide all "escapees"


Suspected BUGS: (needs investigation)
=====================================
- Screendump [S] sometimes doesn't work (Chrome)

Possible IMPROVEMENTS:
=======================

- New bkgCol on colony respawn? - bkgCol changes on respawn? (duplicate?)
- Reset colony lifespan on mouseclick
- Better alternative for Max/Min in GUI? Typed values?
- GUI folders for DNA overrides
- General GUI tidy-up / declutter
REMEMBER! Scaling is important: use relative sizes IMPORTANT!!
- 2 x GUI - one for colours only, one for other stuff?

Ideas for NEW FEATURES:
=======================
+ Instead of specifying individual Strain colors, specify ANGULAR HUE OFFSET between strains?
If (key = '1') {gs = new Global_settings_1}
If (key = '2') {gs = new Global_settings_2}
If (key = '3') {gs = new Global_settings_3}
If (key = '4') {gs = new Global_settings_4}
To select a predefined set of global_settings

TASKS:
======
- Update p5.js version?
- Decide on new TITLE in html
- Instructions? .txt or on-screen text()? (did I make this already?)

- Naming convention - what is this generator called?

How to go on from here towards being able to use the GUI to tweak the generators (& save presets to JSON?)

This could potentially run as a standalone at Tomra....
