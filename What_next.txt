WHAT NEXT????
-------------

Known BUGS:
===========

The overall structure seems vastly overcomplicated!
Colour > DNA > Colour etc. SIMPLIFY IT!
I'm not even 100% sure I like the result - selecting colours rather than random just leads to a lot of fiddling around.
Maybe just keep everything randomised?

Black borders are not refreshed often enough to hide all "escapees"


Suspected BUGS: (needs investigation)
=====================================
- Screendump [S] sometimes doesn't work (Chrome)
- Hide menu with [H] doesn't seem to work

Possible IMPROVEMENTS:
=======================
- Can remove 'fill disable' and 'stroke disable' and simply set Transparency = 0
- New bkgCol on colony respawn? - bkgCol changes on respawn? (duplicate?)
- Reset colony lifespan on mouseclick

- Better alternative for Max/Min in GUI? Typed values?

- General GUI tidy-up / declutter
- GUI folders for DNA overrides
  > Overrides could be 1-9) Setting value 0) "Diversity" "Variance" - scaling value for all DNA?
  Would reduce the need for both Max & Min variables too :-)
  Like http://rik-brown.github.io/Cellendipity/
- Look at aybe_sea - it runs smooth, the GUI is not over-complex. Could I just rebuild that to make a 'mandala' pattern?
- It has a nice 'randomize on restart' function


REMEMBER! Scaling is important: use relative sizes IMPORTANT!!
REMEMBER! populateColony() does not refresh Global_settings!!

- 2 x GUI - one for colours only, one for other stuff? Hopefully not...
- If stepped, stepSizeN = stepSize

Ideas for NEW FEATURES:
=======================
+ Instead of specifying individual Strain colors, specify ANGULAR HUE OFFSET between strains?
If (key = '1') {gs = new Global_settings_1}
If (key = '2') {gs = new Global_settings_2}
If (key = '3') {gs = new Global_settings_3}
If (key = '4') {gs = new Global_settings_4}
To select a predefined set of global_settings

TASKS:
======

- Decide on new TITLE in html Cellendipity Composer?
- Instructions? .txt or on-screen text()? (did I make this already?)

- Naming convention - what is this generator called?

How to go on from here towards being able to use the GUI to tweak the generators (& save presets to JSON?)

This could potentially run as a standalone at Tomra....
