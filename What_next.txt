What next?

Possible bugs:


- Not allow spawn from mouse just anywhere?

Could be IMPROVED with:
=======================
- A neater way of stopping once the radius gets super-small (or x # frames after start?)
- bkgCol changes on respawn? 
- Screendump should work
- Update p5.js version?
- is this.colonySize in use? Removed from GUI...

- New bkgCol on colony respawn

- GUI folders for DNA overrides
	+ spiral max/min
	+ noise% max/min

REMEMBER! Scaling is important: use relative sizes IMPORTANT!!

If (key = '1') {gs = new Global_settings_1}
If (key = '2') {gs = new Global_settings_2}
If (key = '3') {gs = new Global_settings_3}
If (key = '4') {gs = new Global_settings_4}
To select a predefined set of global_settings

Instructions?
Naming convention - what is this generator called?

How to go on from here towards being able to use the GUI to tweak the generators (& save presets to JSON?)

This could potentially run as a standalone at Tomra....
